# gosu-background-hider
Recursively search for backgrounds at osu! songs folder and hide them
Backgrounds are hidden by adding a removed to the end of file extension, making osu not recognize them.
IMPORTANT: After executing the script, restart osu!, or else, it will try to refresh all the songs(it's not needed).

if you want to unhide backgrounds, set RemoveBackgrounds to 0 at settings.json and run
